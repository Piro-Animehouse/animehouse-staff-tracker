# Animehouse: A Staff Tracker
---
## Tracking Anime (and Manga) staff sucks
### But it doesn't have to
<p>
  A lot of information aggregate websites and webapps exist for anime and manga. That in and of itself presents a problem as the information pertaining to the industry isn't perfectly monolithic. Because of that, preferences between UI and UX arise, and quite frankly every aggregate site out there has a subpar experience for both the addition of staff credits, as well as the viewing of them.

  In my eyes, it's the early warning signs of a potential crisis for accessibility and information. Though, that's not what this staff tracker is for. No, this is purely a proof of concept webapp that's meant to be used as a blueprint for improvements to websites such as <a href="https://anilist.co/home" target="_blank">Anilist</a>.
